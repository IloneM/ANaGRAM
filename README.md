# ANaGRAM: A Natural Gradient Relative to Adapted Model for efficient PINNs learning
## Running instructions
This code is based on the code of E-NGD available at <https://github.com/MariusZeinhofer/Natural-Gradient-PINNs-ICML23>.
For the needs of this paper, we forked it and made it available anonymously at <https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Natural-Gradient-PINNs-ICML23-3815/>.
You should then download first this code in the folder Natural-Gradient-PINNs-ICML23.
